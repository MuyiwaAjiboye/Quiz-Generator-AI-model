            Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its readability and extensive ecosystem. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability through significant whitespace and clear syntax.

            Core Python Concepts:

            Variables and Data Types:
            - Dynamic typing allows variable type changes
            - Basic types: int, float, str, bool
            - Complex types: list, tuple, dict, set
            Example type handling:
            x = 5           # int
            x = "Hello"     # now a str
            x = [1, 2, 3]   # now a list
            print(type(x))  # prints: <class 'list'>

            Control Flow Structures:

            Conditional Statements:
            if condition:
                # code block
            elif another_condition:
                # code block
            else:
                # code block

            Loops:
            for item in iterable:
                # process item

            while condition:
                # code block
                if break_condition:
                    break
                if skip_condition:
                    continue

            Functions and Parameters:
            def greet(name, greeting="Hello"):    # Default parameter
                return f"{greeting}, {name}!"

            # Args and kwargs
            def flexible_function(*args, **kwargs):
                for arg in args:
                    print(arg)
                for key, value in kwargs.items():
                    print(f"{key}: {value}")

                        self._balance += amount
                        return True
                    return False

    "data_structures": """
            Data Structures form the fundamental building blocks of computer science and software development. They provide organized ways to store and manage data efficiently, directly impacting program performance and resource utilization.

            Arrays and Lists represent the most basic form of data organization. An array is a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations, making it incredibly efficient for accessing elements using their index positions. When you access an element in an array using its index, the operation happens in constant time O(1) because the computer can directly calculate the memory address of that element. However, arrays come with limitations - their size is typically fixed at creation time, and inserting or deleting elements can be expensive as it might require shifting many elements.

            Lists, particularly dynamic lists or ArrayLists, evolved to address these limitations. They provide the same direct access benefits of arrays but can grow or shrink as needed. Behind the scenes, when a dynamic list fills up, it typically creates a new, larger array (usually double the size) and copies all elements over. While this seems expensive, the amortized cost of insertions remains O(1), making dynamic lists very practical for many applications.

            Linked Lists introduce a completely different approach to organizing data. Instead of storing elements in contiguous memory, each element (node) contains both data and a reference (or link) to the next element. This structure offers remarkable flexibility - inserting or deleting elements simply requires updating these references, which is a constant time O(1) operation when you have a reference to the relevant position. The trade-off is that accessing elements requires traversing the list from the beginning, resulting in O(n) time complexity for access operations.

            Consider a real-world analogy: Arrays are like numbered seats in a theater - finding a specific seat number is easy, but adding a new seat in the middle requires moving all subsequent seats. Linked Lists are more like a treasure hunt, where each clue points to the next location - following the trail takes time, but adding a new clue only requires updating two references.

            Trees represent a hierarchical organization of data, similar to family trees or organizational charts. Binary Search Trees (BST) are particularly powerful because they maintain their elements in a sorted order while allowing for efficient operations. In a BST, each node has at most two children, with all left descendants having smaller values and all right descendants having larger values than the node itself. This organization enables efficient searching - at each node, you can eliminate half of the remaining elements from consideration, leading to O(log n) time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations in balanced trees.

            However, BSTs can become unbalanced, potentially degrading to O(n) performance. This led to the development of self-balancing trees like AVL Trees and Red-Black Trees. These structures automatically maintain their balance through rotations after insertions and deletions, ensuring consistent O(log n) performance.

            Hash Tables combine the best of both worlds - array-like access speed with dynamic size management. They achieve this through a hash function that converts keys into array indices. A good hash function distributes elements uniformly across the available space, enabling O(1) average case performance for insertions, deletions, and lookups. However, hash collisions (when different keys hash to the same index) must be handled properly, typically through chaining (creating linked lists at each index) or open addressing (finding the next available slot).

            Understanding hash tables is crucial as they form the backbone of many practical applications:
            - Database indexing uses hash tables for quick record lookup
            - Programming language implementations use hash tables for symbol tables
            - Caching systems rely on hash tables for fast data retrieval
            - Spell checkers use hash tables to store dictionaries

            Graphs represent perhaps the most flexible data structure, capable of modeling complex relationships between entities. A graph consists of vertices (nodes) connected by edges, which can be directed (one-way) or undirected (two-way). They can represent anything from social networks (where vertices are people and edges are friendships) to computer networks (where vertices are devices and edges are connections) to map applications (where vertices are locations and edges are roads).

            The two main ways to represent graphs are:
            1. Adjacency Matrices: A 2D array where element [i][j] indicates if there's an edge from vertex i to vertex j. This representation provides O(1) edge lookup but requires O(VÂ²) space, where V is the number of vertices.
            2. Adjacency Lists: Each vertex maintains a list of its neighboring vertices. This approach is more space-efficient for sparse graphs and makes it easier to find all neighbors of a vertex.

            The choice between these representations depends on the graph's density and the types of operations needed. Dense graphs (many edges) might benefit from adjacency matrices, while sparse graphs are better served by adjacency lists.

        "algorithms": """
            Algorithms represent the heart of computer science, providing systematic approaches to solving computational problems. Understanding algorithms isn't just about knowing their steps - it's about comprehending their efficiency, applicability, and trade-offs in different scenarios.

            Sorting algorithms demonstrate fundamental algorithmic concepts and trade-offs beautifully. Bubble Sort, while inefficient with its O(nÂ²) time complexity, illustrates basic algorithm design through its simple approach of repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they're in the wrong order. This algorithm gets its name from the way larger elements "bubble up" to their correct positions.

            The inefficiency of Bubble Sort becomes apparent when dealing with larger datasets, leading to the development of more sophisticated approaches. Merge Sort, for instance, employs a divide-and-conquer strategy. It splits the array into smaller subarrays, sorts them independently, and then merges these sorted subarrays. This approach guarantees O(n log n) time complexity regardless of the input data's initial order. However, it requires additional O(n) space for merging, illustrating an important space-time trade-off.

            Quick Sort, often considered the most practical general-purpose sorting algorithm, also uses divide-and-conquer but with a different approach. It selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the array around it, placing smaller elements before and larger elements after. While its worst-case time complexity is O(nÂ²), its average case performance of O(n log n) and in-place operation make it highly efficient in practice. The choice of pivot selection strategy significantly impacts its performance - common approaches include:
            - Selecting the first or last element (simple but vulnerable to already-sorted arrays)
            - Choosing a random element (better average-case performance)
            - Using the "median-of-three" method (good balance of efficiency and reliability)

            Searching algorithms illustrate how different approaches can dramatically affect performance. Linear Search, while simple and applicable to unsorted data, becomes impractical for large datasets with its O(n) time complexity. Binary Search, requiring sorted data, achieves O(log n) by repeatedly dividing the search space in half. This dramatic improvement shows how additional constraints (sorted data) can enable more efficient algorithms.

            In graph algorithms, Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) represent two fundamental approaches to traversing or searching graph structures. BFS explores all vertices at the current depth before moving to vertices at the next depth level, making it ideal for:
            - Finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs
            - Testing graph bipartiteness
            - Finding all nodes within one connected component

            DFS, on the other hand, explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, making it particularly useful for:
            - Topological sorting
            - Finding strongly connected components
            - Solving maze-like puzzles

            Dynamic Programming (DP) represents a powerful paradigm for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. Unlike simple recursion, DP stores the results of subproblems to avoid redundant computation. The Fibonacci sequence calculation illustrates this perfectly:
            - Naive recursion recomputes the same values multiple times, leading to O(2â¿) complexity
            - DP with memoization stores computed values, reducing complexity to O(n)
            - Bottom-up DP eliminates recursion overhead and further improves space efficiency

            Greedy Algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While this approach doesn't always yield the best solution, it often provides good approximations with better time complexity. Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm exemplifies this approach - at each step, it selects the unvisited vertex with the smallest tentative distance, eventually finding the shortest path to all vertices from the starting point.

                Programming languages serve as the interface between human logic and machine execution. Understanding their evolution, paradigms, and characteristics is crucial for effective software development.

                Python stands out as a high-level, interpreted language known for its readability and versatility. Its philosophy emphasizes code readability with notable use of whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks. Python's dynamic typing means variables can hold different types of values, and type checking happens at runtime. This flexibility comes with both advantages and considerations:

                Python's core features include:
                - Comprehensive standard library ("batteries included" philosophy)
                - Dynamic typing and automatic memory management
                - First-class functions enabling functional programming
                - Rich ecosystem of third-party packages via PyPI
                - Support for multiple programming paradigms

                Consider this Python example of list comprehension:
                numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
                squares = [x**2 for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]
                This concise syntax demonstrates Python's expressive power, accomplishing in one line what might take several lines in other languages.

                JavaScript, originally designed for client-side web programming, has evolved into a versatile language used across the full stack. Its event-driven, non-blocking architecture makes it particularly suitable for network applications. Key JavaScript concepts include:

                Asynchronous Programming:
                JavaScript handles asynchronous operations through:
                - Callbacks (traditional approach)
                - Promises (improved control flow)
                - Async/await (modern, more readable syntax)

                Example of asynchronous evolution:
                // Callbacks
                getData(function(result) {
                    processData(result, function(processed) {
                        saveData(processed);
                    });
                });

                // Modern async/await
                async function handleData() {
                    const result = await getData();
                    const processed = await processData(result);
                    await saveData(processed);
                }

                Java represents the object-oriented paradigm with its "write once, run anywhere" philosophy. It achieves platform independence through the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java's strong typing and compile-time checking help catch errors early in development.

                Java's key features include:
                - Strong type system
                - Extensive class libraries
                - Garbage collection
                - Multi-threading support
                - Platform independence

                Java's approach to object-oriented programming:
                public class BankAccount {
                    private double balance;
                    public synchronized void deposit(double amount) {
                        if (amount > 0) {
                            balance += amount;
                        }
                    }
                }
                This example demonstrates encapsulation, data validation, and thread safety.

                Each language has its own memory management approach:
                - Python uses reference counting with garbage collection
                - JavaScript employs mark-and-sweep garbage collection
                - Java uses generational garbage collection
                These differences impact performance characteristics and usage patterns.

            "databases": """
                Database systems form the backbone of modern data-driven applications, providing structured ways to store, retrieve, and manage data. Understanding database concepts involves both theoretical foundations and practical implementations.

                Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) organize data into tables (relations) with rows (tuples) and columns (attributes). The relational model, based on set theory and predicate logic, provides a mathematical foundation for database operations.

                Database Normalization is a systematic approach to reducing data redundancy and ensuring data integrity. The normal forms represent increasingly strict rules:

                First Normal Form (1NF):
                - Atomic values in each column
                - No repeating groups
                Example transformation:
                Before: Customer(ID, Name, Phone1, Phone2)
                After: Customer(ID, Name) and CustomerPhone(CustomerID, Phone)

                Second Normal Form (2NF):
                - Must be in 1NF
                - No partial dependencies on primary key
                This addresses situations where some columns depend only on part of the primary key.

                Third Normal Form (3NF):
                - Must be in 2NF
                - No transitive dependencies
                Example: If ZIP determines City, and City determines State, storing all three creates potential inconsistencies.

                SQL (Structured Query Language) provides a standardized way to interact with relational databases. Complex queries often involve:

                Joins: Combining data from multiple tables
                SELECT orders.id, customers.name, products.description
                FROM orders
                JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.id
                JOIN products ON orders.product_id = products.id
                WHERE orders.date >= '2023-01-01';

                Transaction Management ensures data consistency through ACID properties:
                - Atomicity: All operations complete successfully or none do
                - Consistency: Database remains in a valid state
                - Isolation: Concurrent transactions don't interfere
                - Durability: Committed changes persist

                Example transaction:
                BEGIN TRANSACTION;
                    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
                    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;
                    -- Only if both updates succeed:
                    COMMIT;
                -- If any operation fails:
                ROLLBACK;

                NoSQL databases emerged to handle scenarios where relational databases prove limiting:

                Document Stores (e.g., MongoDB):
                {
                    "user_id": "12345",
                    "name": "John Doe",
                    "orders": [
                        {"id": "A1", "items": ["book", "pen"]},
                        {"id": "A2", "items": ["notebook"]}
                    ]
                }
                This flexible schema allows for nested data structures and easier scalability.

                Key-Value Stores (e.g., Redis):
                Perfect for caching and session management:
                SET session:user123 "{lastAccess: '2023-10-01', preferences: {...}}"
                GET session:user123

                Graph Databases (e.g., Neo4j):
                Ideal for relationship-heavy data:
                CREATE (john:Person {name: 'John'})-[:FOLLOWS]->(mary:Person {name: 'Mary'})

                Database Indexing significantly impacts performance:
                - B-tree indexes for range queries
                - Hash indexes for exact matches
                - Bitmap indexes for low-cardinality columns
                Understanding index types helps in query optimization.

                Query Optimization involves:

                    - Subword tokenization (BPE, WordPiece)
                    - Character tokenization

                    2. Normalization includes:
                    - Case folding: Converting to lowercase
                    - Accent removal
                    - Unicode normalization
                    Example:

                            );
                        }

                        Backend Development:

                        Node.js and Express:
                        - Event-driven architecture
                        - Middleware pattern
                        - RESTful API design
                        Example Express server:
                        const express = require('express');
                        const app = express();

                        app.use(express.json());

                        app.get('/api/users', async (req, res) => {
                            try {
                                const users = await User.find();
                                res.json(users);
                            } catch (error) {
                                res.status(500).send(error);
                            }
                        });

                        Database Integration:
                        - SQL vs NoSQL
                        - ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
                        - Connection pooling
                        Example Mongoose schema:
                        const userSchema = new Schema({
                            username: { type: String, required: true },
                            email: { type: String, unique: true },
                            createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
                        });

                        Authentication and Security:
                        - JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
                        - OAuth integration
                        - CSRF protection
                        - XSS prevention
                        Example JWT implementation:
                        const generateToken = (user) => {
                            return jwt.sign(
                                { id: user.id },
                                process.env.JWT_SECRET,
                                { expiresIn: '24h' }
                            );
                        };

                        Web Security Best Practices:
                        - HTTPS implementation
                        - Content Security Policy
                        - Secure cookie handling
                        - Input validation
                        Example security middleware:
                        app.use(helmet());
                        app.use(cors());
                        app.use(rateLimit({
                            windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
                            max: 100
                        }));

                        Performance Optimization:
                        - Code splitting
                        - Lazy loading
                        - Caching strategies
                        - Image optimization
                        Example React code splitting:
                        const UserDashboard = React.lazy(() =>
                            import('./components/UserDashboard')
                        );

                        Testing Strategies:
                        - Unit testing (Jest)
                        - Integration testing
                        - End-to-end testing (Cypress)
                        Example Jest test:
                        describe('User API', () => {
                            test('should create new user', async () => {
                                const response = await request(app)
                                    .post('/api/users')
                                    .send(userData);
                                expect(response.status).toBe(201);
                                expect(response.body).toHaveProperty('id');
                            });
                        });

                            Operating Systems (OS) serve as the fundamental software layer between hardware and applications, managing computer resources and providing essential services for both users and programs.

                            Process Management fundamentals:

                            Process States and Transitions:
                            - New: Process is being created
                            - Ready: Waiting to be assigned to processor
                            - Running: Instructions are being executed
                            - Waiting: Process waiting for I/O or event
                            - Terminated: Process has finished execution

                            Process Control Block (PCB) contains:
                            - Process ID and State
                            - Program Counter
                            - CPU registers

                            - Memory management information
                            - I/O status information

                            Context Switching mechanism:
                            1. Save current process state
                            2. Update PCB of current process
                            3. Move PCB to appropriate queue
                            4. Select new process
                            5. Update memory management structures
                            6. Restore new process state

                            - Simple implementation
                            - Can lead to convoy effect
                            Example sequence:
                            P1(burst=24) â P2(burst=3) â P3(burst=3)
                            Average waiting time = (0 + 24 + 27)/3 = 17

                            Shortest Job First (SJF):
                            - Can be preemptive or non-preemptive
                            - Optimal average waiting time
                            - Requires prediction of burst time
                            Example:
